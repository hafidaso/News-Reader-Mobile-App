# Assets

Place your app icon and splash screen images here.

## Required Files

The following files are referenced in `app.json` but are optional for development:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px recommended)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen (2048x2732px recommended)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48px or larger)

## For Development

You can run the app without these files. Expo will use default placeholders.

## To Add Icons

1. Create your app icon images
2. Place them in this folder with the names above
3. Restart the development server

You can use tools like:
- [App Icon Generator](https://appicon.co/)
- [Figma](https://figma.com)
- Any image editor
